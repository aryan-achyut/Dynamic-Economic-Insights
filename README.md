# Regime Switching Optimal Growth Model for India's Economic Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Regime Switching Optimal Growth Model** to analyze India's macroeconomic dynamics across different economic regimesâ€”such as growth, recession, and stagnation. The model leverages historical data from the **World Bank** (1960-2023) and uses key economic indicators (GDP growth, inflation, investment, interest rates, and more) to simulate the interactions between **consumption**, **investment**, and **wealth accumulation**. 

The goal is to provide insights into how regime shifts affect these economic variables and to offer policy-relevant analysis for managing economic downturns or promoting growth.

## Methodology
The model is based on:
- **Optimal Growth Theory**: A dynamic optimization framework where economic agents (households and firms) make decisions to maximize utility from consumption and investment over time.
- **Regime Switching**: A **Markov-switching** framework is employed to capture the transitions between different economic regimes, driven by observed macroeconomic indicators like inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth.
- **Numerical Simulation**: The model uses **dynamic programming** and **Monte Carlo simulations** to simulate how these key indicators evolve over time under different economic conditions.

## Key Features
- Analyzes regime transitions between growth, recession, and stagnation.
- Simulates how macroeconomic variables like consumption, investment, and wealth accumulation respond to economic shifts.
- Provides actionable insights for policymakers to manage inflation, stimulate investment, and support long-term economic growth.
